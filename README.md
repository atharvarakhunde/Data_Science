# Data Science Projects

This repository contains several beginner-friendly data science projects that demonstrate the use of Python for data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. Below is a brief overview of each project:

 # 1. Predicting Movie Ratings with Python

Learn to predict movie ratings using Python. This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

# 2. Predicting Survival on the Titanic

Explore the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. This project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model building.

# 3. Sales Prediction with Python

Analyze sales data and build a predictive model to forecast future sales. This project focuses on handling time-series data, visualization, and regression modeling.

Each project is self-contained with its own dataset and code files.

Feel free to explore and modify the projects to deepen your understanding of data science concepts!
